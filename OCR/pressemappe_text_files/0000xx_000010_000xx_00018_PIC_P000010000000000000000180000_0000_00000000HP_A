EX-KHEDIVE DISOWNED |
BY THE KAISER.

 

FAILURE AS AN INTRIGUER.

(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)

CAIRO, Nov. 6.

As is well known, the ex-Khedive of Egypt
has never accepted his deposition by the British
Government, but El Mokattam arnounces that
Abbas Hilmy Pasha has now sent in his resigna-
tion to the Sultan of Turkey. The Jfokattam’s
story is that, while in Italy, Abbas Hilmy,
whose family is on excellent terms with the
Italian Court, was commissioned by the Kaiser
to intrigue for the preservation of Italian
neutrality. The Kaiser, furious at his failure,
refused to see Abbas Hilmyv when he was
recently in Berlin. Having vainly sought an
audience, and piqued at his rebuff, Abbas
Hilmy sent in his resignation to Stambul,
alleging fatigue and public worries.

Te theze who know him, the idea of the
ex-Khedive, who was never renowred for tact
or political perspicacity, being entrusted with
such a mission with any expectation of success}
appears in the highest. ‘degree humorous, while
his subsequent action is certainly characteristi’ 7

of his temperament. —_—
