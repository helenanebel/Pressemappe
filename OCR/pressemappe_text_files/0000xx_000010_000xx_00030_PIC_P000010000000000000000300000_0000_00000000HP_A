A Kine in Exile

Memories of pre-war politics in
Eavpt will be stirred by the news that:
Abbas Hilmi, the ex-Khedive, is in
Loudon. Abbas, it may be necessary,
to remind the post-war gencration, was
on the throne when the war began. He
was at that moment in Constantinople,
and he never returned to Egypt. He
was (to quote the latest edition of the
Encyclopedia Britannica) deposed by
the British Government “on the
givunds of adherence to the King’s
enemies,’ and was succeeded by his
uncle Sultan Husein, who died during:
the war and was followed by King
Fuad, also an uncle of Abbas.

The ex-Khedive, who came to the
throne in 1692 as a youth, is now a
v.hite-haired man. He has long lived
in comfortable exile, and his recent
decision to renounce his claims to the
throne marks his final disassociation
from Egyptian affairs, except as a s\im-
pathetic observer. Abbas — speaks
exccHent English—it was, he says, the
first language he learned after his
native Turkish,--and in conversation
yesterday he talked of his hope of
renewing old acquaintances here,
though, as he remarked, many are
dead since his last visit before the
war.

Although Abbas is described in most
histories as an opponent of the British
in Feypt his own account of the matter
in looking back on those now legendary
times is that he worked assiduousiy for
a good understanding. The golden
time of his reign he regards as the
short period when Sir Eldon Gorst
represented the Liberal Government in
Egypt, and he speaks with enthusiasm
of the work of that great public
servant, and especially of the first step
that he took towards democratic
institutions in establishing the provin-
cial councils in Egypt. Abbas regards
the regime of Gorst as the pericd when}
things worked most emoothly, under
