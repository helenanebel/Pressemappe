CEX-KHEDIVE’S VISIT TO)
f PALESTINE AND SYRIA. ;

Catro, December 20.

Much attention is being devoted by the
Press here and in Palestine and Syria to
the salt now being oid to the two man-

ated countries by the former, Khedive
Abbss—Hilmi, who is described” as being
associated“with the financial schemes of
a group of European capitalists and to
be interested in the purchase of land in
Palestine. Elsewhere his Highness is
credited with a wish to mediate between
the Jews and Arabs, a suggestion which
‘perhaps owes its origin to a statement
about the Palestinian problem recently
made by the former Khedive in the London
Press. It was recently reported here that
a news agency to deal with the affairs
of the Arabic-speaking countries is about
| to be started in London by Mahmud Bey
Azmy, the Egyptian journalist who has fre-
quently acted as Presa agent for the

former Khedive.—“‘ The Times.”)__ aenmeme=
