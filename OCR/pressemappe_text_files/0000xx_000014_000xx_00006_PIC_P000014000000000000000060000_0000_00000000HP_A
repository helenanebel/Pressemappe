‘THE MEDIATION OF MR. ABBOTT

SINCE it is a British and a sterling area crisis which has
given rise to the Washington discussions, and the United
States alone can take a decisive attitude on the course
these discussions shall pursue, it is inevitable that the
presence of Canada’s Finance Minister and the possible
influence of his viewpoint should have been the subject
of only a small proportion of the immense volume of pre-
liminary comment. It is true that Canada’s import
policy is governed by how much she can afford to buy
from America and how much she can persuade Britain to
send her at the right price; and that her export policy
is governed by how much of her raw material wealth she
can persuade America to purchase and how much of her
foodstuffs she can ship to Britain in the face of austerity.
What happens to Canada depends very materially upon
what the other two members of the financial triumvirate,
Mr. John Snyder and Sir Stafford Cripps, arrange between
them.

But it is also certain that at Washington Canada’s
financial chief, Mr. Douglas Abbott, will be no ‘steeping
partner. Events, in fact, are casting him for the réle of
mediator, not between two litigants who need the help
of a third party to be able to negotiate amicably but
between neighbours whose relations can be spared unneces-
sary strain with the help of another neighbour who has
shared something of the experiences of both and so can
interpret those of each to the other with necessary sym-
pathy.

It is fortunate for Britain that Canada has felt the blast
of dollar shortage in recent years and has had to cut her
consumption, submit to “austerity,” grant preferential
treatment to alternative sources of supply. It is fortunate
for the United States that Canadian raw material pro-
ducers and manufacturers when faced with such a situation
tackled it so manfully that they mastered it in a com-
paratively short period to some extent by increasing their
exports to their southern neighbour. On the one hand,
Canada will be able to appreciate the British argument
that in a world in which American industrial and com-
mercial power is so. overwhelming one can slip into a
dollar crisis without noticing it ; on the other, Mr. Abbott
will nod the head if the American spokesman returns that
when you do notice it then is time to buckle down and get
yourself out of it.

To what extent will Mr. Abbott and his colleagues, Mr.
Lester Pearson, Secretary of State for External Affairs,
and Mr. C. D. Howe, Minister of Trade and Commerce, be

able to influence the course of discussions at Washington
and the decisions to be reached there? Canada’s stake in
the outcome is very vital. Further British economies in
dollar expenditure which might be irritating to United
States exporters would hit Canadian exporters, already
much disturbed, very hard. There may be alternative
markets for some products in Latin America and other
countries of the Commonwealth, but certainly not enough
over the short term. Any steps to reduce the prices of
British exports to Canada which the Washington talks
may make imperative will please Canadian distributors
and consumers, counting upon building up their supplies
from Britain.

It is generally reported from Ottawa that Canada is

behind the United States when the latter country takes a

stern view of the rigidity of the cost structure of British
industry. It would be most surprising if she were not,
seeing that her own industry is very closely modelled upon
that of the United States and is very sensitive to trends
in business activity to the south of the border. At the
same time Canadian manufacturers have recently come up
against the effect of strong competition from American
industry that has been strikingly successful in cutting its
costs and prices as soon as times have demanded it. When
American textiles are coming into Canada at prices one-
fifth to one-quarter less than a year ago, Canadian pro-
ducers and consumers cannot be expected to view with any
great sympathy explanations of why British textiles
remain so expensive.

However, Canada will be able to cite her own example
when it comes to talking over ways and means by which
the entry of British goods into the U.S.A. may be acceler-
ated. Speaking of textiles, Canada did, when circumstances
dictated the wisdom of it, remove the duty on British
cottons and rayons for a time, in spite of objections from
domestic producers, and it was not her fault that the fullest
possible advantage of the situation was not taken while
it lasted. The vindication of the measure is that in the
long run it has not seriously harmed domestic producers,
nor even those of the U.S.A. In the first quarter of 1949,
while the concession was still strongly favouring imports
from Britain, Canadian imports of cotton piece goods from
the U.S.A. were nearly 12 times by volume the quarterly
average for 1937.

With Britain Mr. Abbott may be expected to side,
should the issue of off-shore purchases come to a head.
In the past several months, E.C.A. funds to purchase
shipments of wheat to the United Kingdom have done
much to prevent the Canadian wheat farmer from knowing
something of the hardships which have hit the apple
growers of Nova Scotia and the salmon canners of British”
Columbia. Should the United States Congress insist that
dollars shall not go to buy Canadian wheat.for Britain
when wheat is declared a surplus commodity in the U.S.A.,
the vigorous Mr. Howe is likely to be eloquent in pointing
out how il] will be the effects upon his country’s economy.
With non-ferrous metals as well as foodstuffs among the
commodities which Canada has recently expected to be
able to market in Britain with the aid of dollars from the
Marshall pool, the Canadian delegates may be expected
to speak for continuance of aid at the highest level the
American people can be persuaded to sanction; and for
use of this aid to benefit the greatest number to the
maximum degree.

The continuance of existing aid according to plan, yes.
But, if reports from Ottawa are to be believed, extension
of aid to involve further financial commitments, no.
Mr. Abbott is expected to share Mr. Snyder’s view that
the loans and credits which have been made available
from the Western Hemisphere since the end of the war
have been generous and that the situation does not warrant,
at least at this stage, any further excursions in this direc-
tion. Man for man, Canadians have shown a much readier
appreciation—indeed, under much stronger pressure by
reason of self-interest—than have Americans of the
function of a rich and relatively expanding country as a
purveyor and financier of imports. However, they are
now said to be convinced that it would not really be helpful
to Britain to extend further credits—that if competition
is in fact a hailstorm for the British economy, the British

wence;n!
