THE EX-KHEDIVE IN
GENEVA.

 

. Geneva, January 20.

The ex-Khedive of Egypt is due to arrive
at the Chateau de Lancy, where his children
are staying, in a few days. Abbas Hilmi has
spent a good deal of time-t ergnbour-
hood of Geneva—chiefly at Divonne les Bains,
a few miles away—and in the present turmoil
no doubt its neutral calm appeals to him. He
will find certain Egyptians here ready to wel-
come him as ‘roi en exil,’? amongst them
Ferid Bey, leader of the Egyptian Nationalist
Party.

One is tempted to ask why Ferid has come
to Geneva, instead of marching with the de-°
livering host, and, following on this trend of |
thought, a similar query is arrived at with’
regard to the ex-Khedive himself. Why is he
not with the Turco-Teuton Army which, we
are told, is to restore him to the throne of his
ancestors? The answer, I learn from Egyp-
tion sources here, is that the Young Turks
have no intention at all of restoring Abbas to
the Khedivial throne, which is to be reserved
as a special prize for one of their own chiefs.
Mention has been made in this connection of
Enver Pasha himself. It is believed here inj
some circles that Abbas is convinced of this,
and that he left Constantinople in fear of a
repetition of the attempt on his life last
summer.

Certain it is that after having launched his
proclamation to the Egyptians, in which he
inferred that he was about to arrive with an
army that, would emancipate Egypt from
British rule, he took the road not to Damas-
cus, but to Vienna—rather precipitately, it
is said—and that after a month’s stay in the
Austrian capital he is about to take up his
residence in his former holiday haunts in
Switzerland.—John Cameron, Central News.
