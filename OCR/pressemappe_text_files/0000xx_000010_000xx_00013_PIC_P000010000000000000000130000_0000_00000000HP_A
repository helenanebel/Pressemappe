“4B EX-KHEDIVE AND
// FAMILY FUNDS.

 
 

A SPECIAL INQUIRY.

(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)
CAIRO, Jan. 18.

A special Commission has been charged
with the examination of tho old administration
of the Khedivial Wakfs (religious foundations).
A partial examination of the accounts has
already revealed grave irregularities.

These Wakfs belong to the Khedivial family,
and Abbas Hilmi Pasha, as the head thereof,
was a trustee with the fullest powers of appoint-
ment of the administrative staff. Their mis-
management has long been notorious, and
frequent complaints have been made by the
family ag to the unwarranted decrease in the
revenues accruing to individual members. |
The administrative director has been in Con-'
stantinople with the ex-Khedive, whilst the
sub-director, who had been deported on account
of his intrigues, is now in custody. Just before
the war with Turkey substantial sums were
gent to Constantinople through German_hands
for his Highness, and there is reason to believe
this money was withdrawn from the Khedivial
Wakfs’ funds by the sub-director.

Under the last regime every effort was
made by interested parties to get the admini-
stration of the valuable Wakfs, either Khedivial |
or-private, directly into the hands of the Khedive |
by his nomination as trustee. One of the;
most notorious’ recent cases concerned the,
estates of Ismail’s widows. When the first,
two widows dicd their property was duly
divided between Ismail’s four sons, but on}
the death of his last widow,in 1912, the Grand ;
Cadi suddenly decided that Abbas Hilmi was}
the sole heir. The Wakf property, with a
revenue of £60,000, was consequently transferred
from the control of Ismail’s sons to that ofs
his grandson, the ex-Khedive. Similarly in
;many cases Abbas Hilmi appointed his own,
nominees where the administration should hav
been entrusted to the senior heir of the testaty’ :
Should the suggested inquiry into the Khedj”.al
Wakfs be taken up by the Courts some }”. ghly!
sensational revelations. may be expecf“u.
