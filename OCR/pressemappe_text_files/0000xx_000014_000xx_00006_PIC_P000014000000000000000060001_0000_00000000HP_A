people must provide their own macintosh and gum-boots

Here seems to be an issue upon which Mr. Abbott will
stand shoulder to shoulder with Mr. Snyder in face of
Sir Stafford Cripps. But when it comes to commodity
purchases and investment as opposed to loans there may
be a different line-up. Part of the solution of Canada’s
post-war dollar crisis with the U.S.A. has lain in higher
purchases by the U.S.A. of strategic metals and other
raw materials from the northern neighbour; part of it
has lain in an increase of United States investment in
Canadian projects, both those already established and
those newly launched. These policies have been highly
successful. In fact, if Canada be likened to a kind of
miniature “ sterling area” (which it is, with the present-day
balance of raw materials, foodstuffs and manufactured goods
in its economy), this country provides the perfect example
of what steps to take when a dollar crisis looms.

Unfortunately, the goods which the sterling area has for
sale are not so urgently required by the U.S.A. as, for
example, Canadian metals and minerals and, one might
add, petroleum. Nor are the problems of investment in
Canada so fraught with difficulty as the launching of a
really large-scale United States investment programme in
the United Kingdom and its dependent territories. For
one thing, American investment in Canada is already well
entrenched, and any extension of it is a straightforward
process, without the need for any hard thinking or hard
bargaining. Also, Canada is near, and the close ties which
have been established between the two countries must
give the American investor some confidence that he can
keep his eye on his money——more of an eye than if it were
across the Atlantic or perhaps other more distant oceans.
Some would add that he is encouraged by the predominance
of private enterprise politics to the north.

On the other hand, Mr. Abbott can, if he will, call
attention to the great success of the American investment
programme in Canada, compared with developments in
other parts of the globe. He can suggest that this experience +

with Canadians might well be repeated with their
very close blood relations on the other side of the Atlantic,
in spite of current trends in politics. That investment in
a British Colony which is a potential producer of certain
commodities one day American may be glad to draw upon
is as sound a proposition as investment in plant for pro-
ducing a more expensive substitute. That investment in
British industry which, with all its high-cost structure
and rigidity, on the whole produces a serviceable product,
has more to commend it than investment in the industries
of some (unnamed) countries whose industries are utterly
unconscious of costs.

From this analysis it seems clear that at Washington
Mr. Abbott is cast willy-nilly for the réle of mediator.
And if the financial and economic representative of Canada,
how much more so the political representative. If it is in
Canada’s interests economically that the greatest measure
of accord should be reached between the representatives
of Britain and America, it is even more so politically.
The strategic position of Canada in the present situation
needs no emphasis. No one expects that any serious
political differences will arise between Mr. Bevin and
Mr. Dean Acheson. But if they should, the anxiety of
Mr. Pearson to see them resolved is readily foreseeable.
The decision to invite Canada to take part in the discussions
was an obvious one in view of the effect that any pro-
posals made at Washington will be likely to have upon her
national economy, and the extent to which they will
benefit by her co-operation, but from a wider view it is
good that she be represented at a gathering from which
s0 much for better or for worse in Anglo-American relations
can emerge.
