THE DEPOSED | KAHEDIVE.

 

Abdication Denied. ©:

The correspondent of the New York
World,” Mr. Karl von Wiegand, has
had a conversation with Abbas Hilmi
Pasha, the ex-Khedive, in which the late!
ruler of Egypt denied the right of Great
Britain to depose him, and declared that
it was natural and right that he should
hold to Turkey in the war.

Vienna {‘‘ Times’’ telegram),

April 30.
ex-Khedive of
Typ, vas deposed when Turkey en-
tered the war, to-day emphatically denied
the report that the British Government had
at any time requested him to return to
Egypt or that he had refused to comply with
such a request, and declared that he has
meither abdicated nor renounced his right to
the Egyptian throne. The ex-Khedive is
living as a private citizen at the Imperial
Motel in Vienna, where, through a friend
who has been for many years in the Egyp-
tian service, he received me, and told for the
first time something about the break between
himself and the British, resulting in the loss
of his throne, He was attired in a plain
business suit, and his appearance was rather
that of a keen, successful business man than
of an Oriental ruler.

**No,”’ he said, in reply to my question,
‘itis not true that the English asked me to.
return to Egypt. Quite the contrary. I was}
given to understand that I was not to return,
and that was made so plain that there could
be no misunderstanding of it.’’ Abbas
Hilmi does not like to be referred to as the
ex-Khedive. He still considers himself the
rightful ruler of the land of the Pharaohs.

‘* How does it come that your Highness is
in Vienna instead of Cairo?” I asked.

Abbas Hilmi Pasha,

‘*T was in Constantinople recovering from
a wound inflicted by a would-be assassin
when war broke out. I intended leaving
immediately for Egypt, but the English ad-
vised me not to hurry back; that everything
in Egypt was quiet; that the weather was
too hot in Cairo to make it advisable for me
to return then ; that the trip might prove too
much for me, although it would have been a
short, easy voyage down through the Dar-
danelles in my yacht.

The Break with the British.
‘*When it became evident that Turkey

‘would become involved in the war Sir Louis

Mallet, the British Ambassador at Constan-
tinople, informed me that I should leave
Constantinople, though not to return to
Cairo, but insisted that I must go to Italy
and remain there during the war. I asked
why not Switzerland or elsewhere, but he
said, No, I must go and remain in Italy.
England not only wanted me out of Constan-
tinople, but tried to force me to go to Italy
and remain there. I refused. That caused
the break between myself and the English;
and that is why I am to-day in Vienna in-
stead of my own palace in Cairo.”

The ex-Khedive seemed disinclined to say
what motives actuated England in not want-
ing him to return to Cairo during the war.

“T am telling you the facts of the case
England can best answer for herself as to
the reasons for her wrongful action towards
me,’’ he said when I put that question.

“Ts it to be understood that your Highness
has abdicated?”

‘*No, sir; I have neither abdicated, nor
renounced my own rights, or those of my
children to the throne of Egypt,” he declared
with much emphasis. ‘‘I have worked for
my country for twenty-three years. I owed
allegiance and fealty to the Sultan of Turkey,
of whom Egypt is a dependence. It was
natural and right that I should hold to
Turkey in this war. Racially and in religion
Egypt is part of the Turkish Empire. Egypt
had no complaint to make against. Turkish
sovereignty. Egypt has been autonomous to
the point almost of practical independence.
