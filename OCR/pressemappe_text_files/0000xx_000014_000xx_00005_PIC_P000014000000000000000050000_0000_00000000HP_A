TAX REDUCTIONS
IN CANADA

A “Sunshine Budget”

Otrawa, Marcu 22.

Mr. Douglas Abbott. Minister of
Finance, introducing his “sunshine
Budget” in the Dominion House of
Commons to-night, announced “a con-
Siderable measure of immediate tax
reduction ” and “some further welcome
relaxations in import restrictions.” He
said the high level of revenues would
permit tax cuts while also leaving a
surplus “to provide against future un-
certainties.”

The tax cuts would increase the
purchasing power of Canadians, but
there were now sufficient goods on the
market to meet consumer demands with-
out driving prices higher He though the

inflation spiral had been halted and,

predicted that prices generally might
actually go down during the current
year,

Mr. Abbott reported a’ surplus
of 575,000,000 dollars (£144,000,000
sterling) for the fiscal year 1948/49.

He said that during the past year
Canada had produced a record quantity
of consumer goods—enough to over-

come the most serious shortages. He
went on: ‘
“The post-war world price inflation

appears to have run its course. In some
sectors of the price structure where
increases had been particularly great
prices have begun to recede to more
healthy levels.

- Barring the three major catastrophes
of war, crop failure, and widespread
industrial work stoppages, post-war price
intlation has come to an end.”

Canada’s trading surplus during the

year was_..$450,000,000 (£112,000,000
Sterling).
Paying tribute to the European

| Recovery Programme, he said: “ As the
;result of E.R.P. Europe is rapidly
i recovering confidence in its own future.
The immediate crisis of confidence
which was so alarming two years ago
has passed.”

Mr. Abbott said that tax cuts would
have been ill-advised a year ago when |
there were not sufficient goods on the
market to meet the demand. Now
Canadians were enjoying conditions of
sustained prosperity and higher
standards of living than ever before. |

“INTERFERING” WITH TRADE

Stating that the “problem of main-
taining and extending Canada’s over-
seas exports needs attention,” he said:

“We must search for those adjustments
from day to day and month to month that
will maintain as far as possible our
traditional markets. While attempting to
overcome immediate difficulties, we must
persevere in working out a constructive
solution through trade agreements on a
wide non-discriminatory basis.”

Some countries had embarked upon a
course of barter deals, discrimination,
and the balancing of trade accounts with
individual countries. Mr. Abbott said
such discriminatory outside deals were
“interfering” with Canadian trade.

He was interpreted here as criticising
some current British trading policies when
he added: “ We believe that the inevitable
effect of these bilateral, discriminatory
deals is to diminish the total volume of
world trade.” For Canada to go in for
this type of trading would require wide-
spread Government control of private
trade, with a system of licences and
permits. t

“This may fit into the philosophy of the
Government prevailing in some other
countries, but most Canadians do not like
controls and do not want their Governé
ment getting deeper and deeper into
import and export business.”—Reuter. i
