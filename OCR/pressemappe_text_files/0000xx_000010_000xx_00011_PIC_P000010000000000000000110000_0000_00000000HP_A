{THE DEPOSED KHEDIVE.

Two Fallen Chiefs.

(‘Daily Telegraph” Special.)

It would be vastly interesting to know what
manner of consolation Abbas Hilmi, ex-
Khedive, is receiving at the hands of the
Germans in Berlin for the loss of the throne
he gambled away at their bidding.

© sooner was his deposition proclaimed
than off he rushed with his lamentations to
Vienna and Berlin, where he expects to re-
ceive solace and consolation for the misfortune
that has attended his refusal to return to
Egypt. He is sure to reap a large measure of
' promises—promises made in Germany, especi-
ally manufactured in large quantities to be
distributed amongst all who will accept of
them. Should Abbas expect anything more
tangible and substantial it is to be feared he
will be sorely disappointed. It is also ques-
tionable whether he still believes that the,
Germans could now offer him any compensa-
tion adequate to the loss of the many good
things he has sustained through his foolish
agreement to ally himself with the Young
Turks and become Germany’s catspaw.

In connection with Abbas Hilmi’s journey
to Berlin, it would not be amiss to mention
here his reconciliation with his until recently
arch-enemy, Mohamed_Bey_Farid,- president
of the extimetEgyptian Nationalist party. A
situation more comico-pathetic it is hardly
possible to conceive. It will be remembered
that at one time the ex-Khedive favoured and
strongly supported the Egyptian Nationalist
movement, whose aim was to turn the English
out of Egypt. But with his habitual fickle-
ness he withdrew his support from the cause.
Ructions ensued, and he was bitterly attacked
through the Nationalist organs which he had
encouraged and subsidised. Subsequently the
leaders of the movement, amongst whom were

‘the notorious Abd-el-Aziz Shawish and
Mohamed Farid, were concerned in certain/
publications of a specially virulent character’
against the Khedive and his Government, and

became virtually exiles from Egypt in order

to escape the terms of imprisonment to which

they were condemned.

In Search of Solace. !
And now the two fallen chiefs, both fugi-
tives from their country, meet, and, like some
heroes of melodrama, make up their differ-
ences. And while Abbas Hilmi is wandering
with his grievances from Vienna to Berlin in
search of solace, the newly-appointed Sultan of
Egypt, a more worthy successor to the galaxy
of Egyptian Sovereigns, stretching from
Menes to Salah-el-Dine, and Mohamed Ali, is
taking up the reins of his government, and
composing his household and choosing his en-
tourage. Nothing better denotes the charac-
ter of a person, especially one in an exalted
position, than the choice he makes of the
people who are to surround him. In this also
his Highness the Sultan of Egypt has shown
his accustomed wisdom. He has selected his
entourage wisely and well, and has eliminated
all the elements of intrigue that used to beset
the household of the ex-Khedive. He has
further effected a few changes in the names
and composition of the several branches. S
